        <h3>🌓 Weather, Pressure & Feeding Activity</h3>

        <p>
            The key to success is <strong>atmospheric stability</strong>. 
            A steady barometer often signals consistent feeding. 
            However, many trophy fish in the Pleven region are caught during a 
            <em>falling barometer</em> just before a storm, as predators sense the change and feed aggressively. 
            Always check the wind direction – a warm southerly breeze often brings the fish closer to the banks of our local dams.

        <h3>🎣 Choosing the Right Technique</h3>

        <p>
            When fishing the <strong>Danube</strong>, focus on heavy feeders or heavy-duty spinning gear to handle the strong current. 
            For the <strong>Vit River</strong>, stealth is your best friend – 
            light float tackle or ultra-light spinning for chub (klen) works best. 
            Match your bait to the natural food source in the water for the best results.

        <h3>🌿 Ethics & Conservation (Catch and Release)</h3>
        
        <p>
            Sustainable fishing ensures our children will enjoy the same thrills we do. 
            Practice <strong>Catch and Release</strong> whenever possible, 
            especially for large breeding fish. Never leave nylon lines or plastic waste behind – 
            these are deadly to local birds and wildlife. 
            Leave the spot cleaner than you found it!
